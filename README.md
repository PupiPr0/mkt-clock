This small project is intended to be a tool that displays at what time (locally) some of the most importnat financial exchanges open, while also showing their status (open, closed, pre-market, post-market). For now, NYSE - New York Stock Exchange, LSE - London Stock Exchange and JSX - Japan Stock Exchange are planned to be released.
